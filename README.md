# Real_Time_Stress_Assessment

## Introduction
Wearable devices are very common in our life nowadays such as Apple watch, and Samsung galaxy gear. The characteristic of wearable devices enables them to collect and exchange data between devices or platforms automatically. In terms of the application of wearable devices in health, there is still room for development. The advantage of wearable devices is that it can easily and automatically collect data, such as heart rate, body temperature, and physical information. However, current wearable devices such as Apple Watch are mainly used for information. They don’t analyze or make conclusions based on those data. Today, there is a growing interest to use wearables not only for individual self-tracking but also within corporate health and wellness programs.

## Data
The dataset is obtained from UCI, Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/WESAD+%28Wearable+Stress+and+Affect+Detection%29#)
It contains 15 subjects (people), and each person’s data size is around 1GB. The total size of our raw data is 17.84GB.  The label of the data (ground-truth) is from self-report of the subjects.
